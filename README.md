## Goal

The **Fabric TwinSession** mod enables players to connect to a Minecraft server multiple times using the same account. 

This functionality is particularly useful for those who want the advantages of multiple sessions, 
such as managing different in-game tasks simultaneously, without needing to purchase additional Minecraft accounts. 
When a player connects to the server with the same account for the second time, the mod automatically modifies the playerâ€™s username by 
adding a numerical prefix followed by an underscore (e.g., "1_PlayerName"). 

Each additional session increments this number (e.g., "2_PlayerName", "3_PlayerName", etc.).

## How to Use

### Multiplayer Servers
1. **First Session**: Join the server as usual with your Minecraft account.
2. **Second Session**: Open another Minecraft client and join the same server with the same account. The mod will automatically modify your username (e.g., "1_PlayerName") to allow the connection.
3. **Additional Sessions**: Repeat the process to join the server with more clients using the same account. Each additional session will receive a sequentially numbered username (e.g., "2_PlayerName", "3_PlayerName").

### Singleplayer (LAN)
1. **Set Up**: Start your Minecraft world and select "Open to LAN" from the pause menu.
2. **Connecting**: Follow the same process as in Multiplayer to connect with multiple clients using the same account.

This mod is ideal for players who wish to multitask effectively, such as managing in-game farms or automation, without the need for a separate Minecraft account.
